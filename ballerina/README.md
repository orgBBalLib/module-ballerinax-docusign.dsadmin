## Overview

[DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/) is a leading electronic signature and agreement cloud platform that enables organizations to manage electronic agreements, automate workflows, and securely sign documents from virtually anywhere.

The `ballerinax/docusign.dsadmin` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [DocuSign Admin API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/admin-api/) endpoints, specifically based on [DocuSign Admin API v2.1](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/admin-api/reference/).
## Setup guide

To use the DocuSign Admin connector, you must have access to the DocuSign Admin API through a [DocuSign developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/) and obtain an API access token. If you do not have a DocuSign account, you can sign up for one [here](https://www.docusign.com/free-trial).

### Step 1: Create a DocuSign Account

1. Navigate to the [DocuSign website](https://www.docusign.com/) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. Ensure you have a DocuSign Organization with Admin privileges, as the DocuSign Admin API requires organization-level access and is available to accounts with the DocuSign Admin feature enabled (typically included in Enterprise plans or as an add-on).

### Step 2: Generate an API Access Token

1. Log in to your [DocuSign Developer Account](https://developers.docusign.com/) and navigate to the Apps and Keys page.

2. Click on Add App and Integration Key to create a new application, or select an existing application.

3. Copy your Integration Key (Client ID) and configure the authentication settings for your application.

4. For development and testing purposes, navigate to the Apps and Keys page and click on Actions > Generate Access Token to obtain a temporary access token.

5. For production use, implement OAuth 2.0 authentication (Authorization Code Grant or JWT Grant) to obtain access tokens programmatically.

> **Tip:** You must copy and store this key somewhere safe. It won't be visible again in your account settings for security reasons.
## Quickstart

To use the `docusign.dsadmin` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

```ballerina
import ballerina/oauth2;
import ballerinax/docusign.dsadmin as dsadmin;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Create a `Config.toml` file and configure the obtained credentials:

```toml
clientId = "<Your_Client_Id>"
clientSecret = "<Your_Client_Secret>"
refreshToken = "<Your_Refresh_Token>"
```

2. Create a `dsadmin:ConnectionConfig` and initialize the client:

```ballerina
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;
configurable string refreshToken = ?;

final dsadmin:Client dsadminClient = check new ({
    auth: {
        clientId,
        clientSecret,
        refreshToken,
        refreshUrl: "https://account.docusign.com/oauth/auth"
    }
});
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Get a list of organizations

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    dsadmin:OrganizationsResponse response = check dsadminClient->/v2/organizations();
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
